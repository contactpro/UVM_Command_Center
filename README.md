# UVM COMMAND CENTER
# UVM Testbench Workflow Automation Demo / Reference Design (Concept)
# UVM FPGA/ASIC/SoC Design Verification Workflow Tutorial

UVM Testbench Workflow Automation Demo for Educational (and freemium baseline ideas and concepts).
UVM Testbench Workflow and evolution into (Public/Private/Hybrid) Cloud Devops. 

The UVM COMMAND CENTER python aplication is a UVM FPGA/ASIC Design Verification Workflow Tutorial/Demo. UVM COMMAND CENTER / UVM Testbench Builder Software Application written in PYTHON and built with cx_Freeze. The UVM Testbench Builder Software Application has UVM workflow tutorial and educational attributes. The UVM Testbench Builder Software Application will eventually utilize Cloud Infrastructure(s) to scale. 

Currently, only GITHUB releases of the source code are available as these three identical source code copies:

uvm_builder_python.py , uvm_builder_python_backup.py , uvm_see1.py

Later, a WINDOWS 10 / WINDOWS 11 MSI file executable will be produced by modifying the cxfreeze script in this GITHUB repository.

This UVM COMMAND CENTER python application will evolve to include powerful features as it develops into a UVM Testbench Builder App, written in PYTHON and built with cx_Freeze. This UVM COMMAND CENTER workflow educational software application will eventually be upgraded to utilize Cloud Infrastructure(s) to scale.

Note: The Original Baseline, contact_management_python_version_14_2.py, sort of a learn-how-to-create-a-quick-Tk-GUI features and experimentation exercise, was utilized to create the UVM COMMAND CENTER. Therefore, there is quite a bit of python code, globals and classes/methods, that corresponds to Contact Manager Python (baseline) that can, should, will be removed as we transform contact_management_python_version_14_2.py into uvm_builder_python.py (which has three identical copies, the other two being uvm_builder_python_backup.py and uvm_see1.py). I coded uvm_builder_python.py, The UVM COMMAND CENTER python application, quickly, to present the concept and workflow automation of a simple (block level) UVM Testbench Workflow IDE (Integrated Development Environment) DEMO. This is an evolving tutorial or educational PYTHON/Tkinter GUI and App for automating the basic workflow and eventually the Cloud DevOps of a simple block level UVM Testbench.
