# UVM COMMAND CENTER
# UVM Testbench Builder
# UVM FPGA/ASIC Design Verification Workflow Tutorial/Demo.

The UVM COMMAND CENTER python aplication is a UVM FPGA/ASIC Design Verification Workflow Tutorial/Demo. UVM COMMAND CENTER / UVM Testbench Builder Software Application written in PYTHON and built with cx_Freeze. The UVM Testbench Builder Software Application has UVM workflow tutorial and educational attributes. The UVM Testbench Builder Software Application will eventually utilize Cloud Infrastructure(s) to scale. 

Currently, only GITHUB releases of the source code are available as these three identical source code copies:

uvm_builder_python.py
uvm_builder_python_backup.py
uvm_see1.py

Later, a WINDOWS 10 / WINDOWS 11 MSI file executable will be produced by modifying the cxfreeze script in this GITHUB repository.

This UVM COMMAND CENTER python application will evolve to include powerful features as it develops into a UVM Testbench Builder App, written in PYTHON and built with cx_Freeze. This UVM COMMAND CENTER workflow educational software application will eventually be upgraded to utilize Cloud Infrastructure(s) to scale.

In summary,  the Original Baseline contact_management_python_version_14_2.py was utilized to create the UVM COMMAND CENTER.
