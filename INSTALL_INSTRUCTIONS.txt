   Here are the STEPS:

1. Click on the LINK https://tinyurl.com/CONTACT-MANAGEMENT-EXPERT 
   to see the Google Drive Shared Folder with the INSTALLER FILE in there.
   The INSTALLER FILE is CM-14.2-amd64.msi (the standard Microsoft Installer File).

2. Download the INSTALLER FILE, CM-14.2-amd64.msi, from the Google Drive Shared Folder. 
   The File only takes about 15 to 20 seconds to download.
   The Installer File is called CM-14.2-amd64.msi and after you download this
   CM-14.2-amd64.msi Installer File, it will be located in your Downloads Folder
   on your Windows 10 PC or Laptop.

3. Go to your DOWNLOAD Folder on your PC and COPY this Installer
   file, CM-14.2-amd64.msi, that you just downloaded to whatever Folder you want.
   Create a Folder and PASTE the INSTALLER File in the new Folder.
   I suggest creating a Windows Folder called .../CM_INSTALLER_VERSION_14.2

4. RIGHT CLICK ON THE INSTALLER FILE, CM-14.2-amd64.msi, and select Install.
   The Installer will prompt you with a textbox where you have the
   option to change the Windows Folder where the application 
   is installed. You can just select OK to continue installing
   at the default path (the Windows "Program Files" Folder called 
   CM) or select a folder name you specify).

5. After the Installer File is finished, locate the File: contact_management_python.exe 
   in the Windows "Program Files" Folder called "CM"
   or select the folder name that you specified, and double click 
   on this contact_management_python.exe to see it run OK. 
   Then go back and RIGHT CLICK on that same file: contact_management_python.exe 
   and select PIN TO START MENU. (You can also create a shortcut 
   for contact_management_python.exe and place the shortcut on your desktop).
